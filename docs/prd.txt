# **PRD – Smart Email Assistant**

---

## **1. Project Overview**

Build an **AI-powered Email Assistant** that can **categorize emails, auto-draft responses, and schedule meetings** autonomously. The system should connect to Gmail via API, use **CrewAI** for agent orchestration, and **GPT-4 (or Gemini)** for intelligent language processing.

This assistant aims to **reduce inbox overload** by automating repetitive tasks and is designed for **maximum demo appeal** with viral “AI doing your job” content.

---

## **2. Goals**

* Demonstrate **autonomous agent capabilities** using real-world email workflows.
* Showcase **business productivity impact** (email triage, response, scheduling).
* Create **viral build-in-public TikTok content** (hook: “AI runs my inbox”).
* Build within **8–12 hours (1–2 days)** for fast delivery and social proof.

## **3. Key Features**

### ✅ **Core Features**

1. **Email Categorization**

   * Fetch emails from Gmail inbox.
   * Categorize into: *Important, Newsletters, Promotions, Meetings, Personal*.
   * Use Gmail labels for organization.
2. **Auto-Draft Responses**

   * For selected emails, generate contextual replies (using GPT-4/Gemini).
   * Respect tone and content requirements (e.g., formal for clients).
3. **Meeting Scheduling**

   * Identify meeting-related emails.
   * Auto-suggest time slots or create events in Google Calendar via API.
4. **One-Click Approval**

   * Human review before sending drafts (toggle for full automation later).

### ✅ **Optional Features (Stretch Goals)**

* Sentiment analysis → Flag urgent or negative emails.
* Priority scoring → Rank emails by importance.
* Summarize threads → Show quick digest of long email chains.

---

## **4. User Flow**

1. **Connect Gmail Account**

   * OAuth flow → Grant access to read and send emails.
2. **Dashboard/Console**

   * Show latest 50 emails.
   * Display categories (tabs or tags).
3. **Auto Actions**

   * Categorize emails instantly.
   * Generate draft responses for emails marked “Reply.”
   * For scheduling requests → Suggest 3 slots and insert Google Calendar invite.
4. **Review & Approve**

   * User approves drafts → Agent sends via Gmail API.
5. **Demo View**

   * Include real-time console showing: *AI reading, classifying, drafting, scheduling.*

---

## **5. Technical Architecture**

### **Stack**

* **Backend:** Python
* **Agent Framework:** LangChain for multi-agent tasks)
* **LLM:** GPT-4 or Gemini
* **APIs:**

  * Gmail API (for email read/send)
  * Google Calendar API (for scheduling)
* **Database:** Local JSON or SQLite for demo (optional).
* **Deployment:** Local run or lightweight Streamlit dashboard.

---

### **Core Components**

* **Email Fetcher:** Uses Gmail API to pull emails (subject, sender, body).
* **Categorizer Agent:** GPT-powered agent → classify email into categories.
* **Responder Agent:** Drafts replies using contextual LLM prompts.
* **Scheduler Agent:** Detects meeting-related emails → creates calendar event via Google Calendar API.
* **Controller:** CrewAI orchestrates agent sequence.

---

## **6. Demo Angle**

Hook:
✅ *“Watch my AI agent handle 50 emails in 30 seconds.”*
Show live console:

* **Phase 1:** Fetch emails → Display classification.
* **Phase 2:** Auto-generate drafts → Show editable text.
* **Phase 3:** Schedule meetings → Confirm events in Google Calendar.

**TikTok Content Plan:**

* **Day 1:** “Building an AI that reads my emails so I don’t have to.”
* **Day 2:** “My AI agent just scheduled 5 meetings while I made coffee.”
* **Day 3:** “Plot twist: The AI is better at email than I am.”
* **Day 4:** “Starting project 2: AI that plans your entire conference experience.”

---

## **7. Success Metrics**

* Handles **50+ emails in under 1 minute** for demo.
* Correctly categorizes **>90%** of emails.
* Auto-generates **contextually correct responses** for at least 5 emails.
* Successfully schedules **2+ meetings** via Calendar API.

---

## **8. Timeline (8–12 hours total)**

* **Hour 1–2:** Set up Gmail & Calendar API, Langchain skeleton.
* **Hour 3–4:** Build categorizer agent.
* **Hour 5–6:** Build responder agent (with approval toggle).
* **Hour 7–8:** Build scheduler agent + Google Calendar integration.
* **Hour 9–10:** Test on sample inbox.
* **Hour 11–12:** Create demo dashboard (Streamlit) + record TikTok content.

---

## **9. Deliverables**

* **GitHub Repo:** Well-documented code, instructions, sample `.env`.
* **Demo Video:** Full run → Email triage, reply drafting, meeting scheduling.
* **TikTok Clips:** 4-part build-in-public series.
