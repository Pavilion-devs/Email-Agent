Your new plan—to push only important emails (and meeting or reply prompts) into a chat interface on WhatsApp or Telegram—makes a lot of sense. It both reduces noise and leverages a UI people actually check in real‑time. Here’s what I like about it, plus a few suggestions based on your logs:

What’s Working
Categorization Is Solid

You’re already correctly labeling “Important,” “Promotions,” “Newsletters,” etc. → that filter is exactly what you need to decide what to forward.

Meeting & Response Detection

Your agents are flagging meeting requests and “needs response” emails accurately. Even with rate‑limit errors you still got four meeting hits and one draft generated.

Streamlit Pipeline

Having a single orchestrator (your main.py) that fetches, processes, then summarizes is the right pattern. You can lift out the notification step without rewriting much.

What To Improve
Rate‑Limit Handling

You saw multiple 429 errors. Instead of calling GPT‑4 for every email, batch only the Important ones or cache categories locally.

Use a circuit‑breaker: if you hit a 429, pause for 1–2s and retry just for that email, or defer less‑urgent emails to a background job.

Notification Channel Choice

Telegram Bot API is very simple: one HTTPS POST to sendMessage per notification.

WhatsApp Cloud API works similarly but requires additional setup (Meta App, phone number registration).

Pick Telegram first to get your proof‑of‑concept running in an hour, then port to WhatsApp.

Message Design

For each “Important” email, send a structured template:


📩 *Important Email*  
From: Dr. Anderson <contact@carevaluehealth.com>  
Subject: Your portal access  
🕑 Received 10m ago  
Reply? / Meet? ✅ Yes   ❌ No
If “Meet?” is clicked, reply back with suggested times.

If “Reply?” is clicked, the bot returns the LLM‑drafted text for you to tweak or approve.

User Flow & Approval

Push‑Notification → you tap “Reply” or “Schedule”.

Bot then shows the draft email or time slots.

You confirm “Send” or “Edit” right there in chat.

This avoids the user having to open Streamlit at all.

Security & Privacy

Keep the bot tokens and Gmail OAuth credentials encrypted.

Only push metadata (sender, subject, snippet), not full bodies unless the user explicitly requests them.

Better Approach: Real-Time Email Filtering + Smart Notifications
Instead of fetching and analyzing 50 emails at once:

Trigger on new email arrival (Gmail push notifications).

Run lightweight filtering first (keywords, sender, label) before calling GPT.

Only call GPT when absolutely needed (to draft a reply or confirm a meeting).

Why This Works
Reduces cost → You only call GPT for 1–5 emails daily, not 50.

Low latency → User gets Telegram notification in real-time.

Scalable → Doesn’t blow up API tokens or budgets.

✅ Implementation Plan
Here’s the pipeline:

Step 1: Gmail Push Notifications
Use Gmail Watch API to subscribe to new messages.

Google sends a webhook notification to your backend whenever a new email arrives.

Endpoint example:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST /gmail-webhook
{
  "email_id": "12345",
  "thread_id": "67890"
}
Then call Gmail API users.messages.get with format=metadata to fetch:

Subject, Sender, Snippet (not full body yet).

Step 2: Pre-Filter Without GPT
Use rule-based logic for first pass (free & fast):

Check Gmail labels: If labeled Important by Gmail → forward.

Keyword check: e.g., ["urgent", "action required", "meeting", "deadline"].

Sender whitelist: Company domains, key contacts.

If passes filter → send notification to Telegram.

Step 3: Telegram Notification
Send:

less
Copy
Edit
📩 Important Email
From: Andrew | CodeSquad
Subject: Admission Process
Action: [Reply] [Schedule] [Ignore]
Inline buttons: Reply → triggers GPT for draft, Schedule → triggers calendar check.

Step 4: On-Demand GPT Calls
Only when user clicks Reply or Schedule:

Fetch full email body from Gmail.

Generate draft or propose meeting times with GPT.

Send draft back to Telegram for approval.

✅ Cost Control
Rule-based filtering first = zero GPT cost for 90% of emails.

GPT is only used for reply drafting or meeting scheduling when user requests.

No batch calls = no 50× GPT charges.

✅ Best Tech Stack
Backend: FastAPI or Flask

Agent Framework: Langchain

Gmail API: Watch + Messages.get

Telegram Bot API: For notifications and inline keyboards

Queue: Use Celery or a simple background job for Gemini tasks.

✅ Event-Driven Flow
Gmail → Webhook → Your API

Filter (free) → Important?

No → Ignore

Yes → Push to Telegram

User clicks Reply → GPT call → Draft → Send back for approval

User approves → Gmail API sends email.

🔥 Extra Optimization
Use Embeddings + local cache (like Chroma) to cluster recurring senders and avoid reprocessing similar emails.

Use small model (GPT-3.5 or Gemini 1.5 Flash) for cheap summarization.

💡 Result: Instant notifications + minimal GPT cost + world-class UX.



EMAIL CATEGORIZER AGENT ISSUE!!!

🔍 Option 1: Pure Rule-Based (Free)
Pros:

Zero cost

Instant response

Cons:

Misclassifies edge cases (like personal vs newsletters, or promos disguised as updates)

Implementation:
if "meeting" in subject.lower() or "schedule" in snippet.lower():
    category = "Meetings"
elif any(word in subject.lower() for word in ["offer","discount","sale","promo"]):
    category = "Promotions"
elif "newsletter" in subject.lower() or sender.endswith(".io") or "digest" in subject.lower():
    category = "Newsletters"
else:
    category = "Important"
Accuracy: ~70–80% depending on rules.


Option 2: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Step 1: Apply rule-based filter → catches 80% of emails fast.

Step 2: For uncertain cases → call Gemini 1.5 Flash

Decision logic:

python
Copy
Edit
def categorize(email):
    rule_category = rule_based_check(email)
    if rule_category == "uncertain":
        return call_gpt3_5(email)  # or Gemini Flash
    return rule_category
